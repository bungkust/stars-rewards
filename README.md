# Star Habit 🌟

**Star Habit** is a scientifically-grounded, gamified habit tracker designed to help families build better routines, teach responsibility, and make daily tasks fun for kids.

Built with privacy in mind, it runs completely offline on your device—no accounts, no tracking, just simple, effective parenting tools.

## 🚀 Why Parents Need This

Parenting often involves a struggle between nagging for compliance and wanting to build a positive relationship. **Star Habit** bridges this gap by shifting the focus from **correction** to **connection**.

*   **Eliminate Power Struggles:** Instead of "do this or else," it becomes "do this to earn stars." This simple shift gives children autonomy and reduces defiance.
*   **Teach Financial Literacy:** Kids learn the fundamental concept of **Work = Reward**. They learn to save for big items (delayed gratification) vs. spending on small treats immediately.
*   **Build Lasting Habits:** By externalizing the motivation (stars), you help children initiate tasks until they become internalized habits.
*   **Focus on the Positive:** It forces you to catch your child doing *good*, rather than just correcting them when they do *bad*.

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

This app isn't just a sticker chart; it's a digital implementation of a **Token Economy System**, a behavior modification technique backed by decades of psychological research.

### 1. Token Economy & Positive Reinforcement
Research by **Alan E. Kazdin**, a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University, demonstrates that **positive reinforcement** (rewarding desired behavior) is significantly more effective for changing behavior than punishment.
> *"Punishment can stop a behavior, but it cannot teach a new one. Positive reinforcement teaches the child what to do."*

**Star Habit** uses "Stars" as immediate tokens that bridge the gap between the behavior (cleaning room) and the backup reinforcer (screen time/toy). This immediate feedback loop is crucial for the developing child's brain.

### 2. Gamification & Dopamine
Gamification taps into the brain's reward system. Earning a star releases a small amount of **dopamine**, the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and motivation.
*   **Research:** Studies in *Frontiers in Psychology* show that gamified elements (points, streaks, badges) increase intrinsic motivation and engagement in non-game contexts like chores and learning.
*   **Benefit:** It turns "boring" tasks into "quests," reducing the friction of starting a task.

### 3. Autonomy & Competence (Self-Determination Theory)
By allowing children to *choose* which tasks to complete to earn their rewards, you support their need for **Autonomy**. Seeing their balance grow supports their need for **Competence**.
*   **Benefit:** Children who feel autonomous and competent are more likely to cooperate and develop self-discipline.

## ✨ Key Features

3.  **Do:** Your child logs in, sees their tasks, and marks them as "Done".
4.  **Verify:** You enter your PIN to approve the work. Stars are added to their balance!
5.  **Redeem:** Your child "buys" a reward, and you fulfill it.
