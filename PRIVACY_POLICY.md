# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 20, 2026**

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Star Habit** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your family's privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles information when you use it.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
Star Habit is designed as an **offline-first** application. 
- **Personal Information:** We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) to our servers. All data you enter—including child names, missions, tasks, and reward histories—is stored locally on your device.
- **Photos/Camera:** The application may request access to your camera to allow children to submit photo evidence of completed tasks. These photos are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers.
- **Location Data:** We do NOT collect or track your location.

## 3. Third-Party Services
While the app is offline-first, it provides an optional feature to sync or backup your data:
- **Google Drive Sync:** If you choose to enable Google Drive backup, the app will request permission to access your Google Drive to store a backup file. This data is stored in your private Google Drive account and is not accessible by us. Use of this feature is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.
- **No Third-Party Analytics/Ads:** We do NOT use third-party analytics (like Firebase or Facebook SDK) or ad networks that track your behavior.

## 4. Children’s Privacy
Our app is designed for families and children. 
- **COPPA & GDPR-K Compliance:** Because we do not collect any personal information from any user (including children) on our servers, we are fully compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- **Parental Control:** The "Admin" features of the app are protected by a PIN, ensuring that parents or guardians remain in control of the rewards and task verification process.

## 5. Data Storage and Security
All application data is stored in the local storage of your device. 
- **Security:** We recommend using device-level security (passcodes, biometrics) to protect the data on your phone.
- **Data Deletion:** To delete all data associated with the app, you can simply uninstall the application or clear the app's cache/data in your device settings.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
